## Problem Statement


I've got this secret recipe for the most mouthwatering dish ever, but I couldn't just write it down normally! 😎 To make it extra secure, I scrambled it up in a special way.

First, I XOR-ed it with a secret byte—but there's a catch: I forgot which byte I used! The secret ingredient is hidden inside the format:

📜 RCSC{secret_ingredient}

Now, I’m starving and need your help to crack the code before it’s too late! 🍕🍽️To help you out, I’ve got a little encrypted treat I like to call "**Chef’s Secret Sauce**":

[***Sauce.txt***](Sauce.txt)

Maybe the **problem name** is a **clue** to unlock the mystery? 🕵️‍♂️

## Problem Setter  

This challenge was created by **Shoaib Bin Rashid**—a cryptography enthusiast who believes that **XOR-ing things makes them secure**... until he forgets the key. 🤦‍♂️  

Rumor has it he once **encrypted his grocery list** and couldn't figure out what to buy for dinner. Now, he's hoping you can crack this recipe before he starves! 🍕🍽️  

If you find any issues (or just want to laugh at his forgetfulness), feel free to reach out! 🧩🔐
