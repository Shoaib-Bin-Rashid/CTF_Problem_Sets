# Basic RSA

## Problem Statement
Captain Crypto is a legendary treasure hunter, but he has a huge problem. He found a treasure map, but to keep it safe from pirates, he encrypted it using RSA. Now, Captain Crypto can't remember the key, and he needs your help to find the treasure!

Hereâ€™s what Captain Crypto wrote in his note:

"I encrypted the treasure map using RSA, but I forgot the key! Here's what I remember:
```
N = 1280678415822214057864524798453297819181910621573945477544758171055968245116423923
C = 655181329787135529998377901672522740575357589761975528598378958663813197501927937
E = 65537
```
Can you crack the code and claim the treasure?"
