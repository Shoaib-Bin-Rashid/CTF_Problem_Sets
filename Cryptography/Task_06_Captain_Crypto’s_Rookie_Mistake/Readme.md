# Captain Crypto’s Rookie Mistake

## Problem Statement
Captain Crypto, in a rush to secure his treasure map, used RSA encryption. However, being impatient, he chose **e = 3** for "faster encryption" and didn’t realize his mistake. His message was **too small**, making the encryption weak!

Luckily, you intercepted the encrypted message. Can you decrypt it and find where the treasure is hidden?

### **🔐 Given:**

-   **Modulus**: n = `101176414772683129053545554667990275435210329721148508675803761203124162852403355868402686687061426038776606345395791951227849682777776441507162915204319287964303488787285658634756748084435332993089256258832642730128164289603954253137619564838492466632808053870541826322864432339896923643102700138813227955923`
-   **Public exponent**: e = `3` 
-   **Ciphertext**: c = `7637571935836530936561108981028461653972782268548286459580455649257265696870262731865816544184422190794387755032868422825517132438988191511090982834713240249542670205846570004344419696877748407376982924395476610305756892860438972310476617905270109172330175288`
