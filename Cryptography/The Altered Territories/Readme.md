# The Altered Territories

## Problem Statement

A terrorist organization called the Cyber Enclave has intercepted critical data and hidden it behind cryptographic barriers. They’ve altered the names of three key districts in Bangladesh and encrypted them with hashes. This data could expose their plans for a devastating attack, and your mission is to uncover the original district names before it’s too late.

Each district name has been modified using a character substitutions and symbolic replacements, but the length of the names remains the same. Your task is to reverse these modifications, crack the hashes, and uncover the flag before the attack happens.

District 1 : 11b78dfce5ed07d2c43c100d2cbd16f3fa83ae197d427410fce3a643aa6605a3
District 2 : 1436d15b19a68e44350bdb29731b4f4e
District 3 : e7992596b629886d8fa91384ba595ad47b9d458d

The flag is hidden in the format:
RCSC{District1_District2_District3}

This challenge was brought to you by Shoaib Bin Rashid—a cryptography enthusiast who once tried hashing his passwords with salt but ended up seasoning his dinner instead. 🍛🔐 He’s still wondering why his decryption script outputs cat memes instead of plaintext. 😹

If you crack the code, let him know—or just share your favorite OSINT tricks and your go-to debugging snack. 🍕🧩💀
