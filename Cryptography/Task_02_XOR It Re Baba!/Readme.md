## **Problem Name: XOR It Re Baba!**  

I've hidden a **super-secret phrase**, but I couldn't just leave it out in the open! 😏 So, I got a little creative and **XOR-ed** it multiple times with different keys. The catch? Some of them are already mixed together, and you need to untangle this XOR mess!  

Here’s what you have to work with:  

- Two mysterious keys seem to be tangled together:  
  📌 `K1 ^ K2 = 419110a1d222b09030b1b1727232311`  
- Another XOR mix-up:  
  📌 `K2 ^ K3 = 41b0123150d2037010a3f0922040827020604090409`  
- The final key is no longer a secret:  
  🔑 `K3 = "AreBabaEdaKhaliEktaKey"`  
- The phrase you're searching for is hiding under:  
  ❓ `BujhlamNa ^ K1 ^ K2 ^ K3 = 4060a26083d263414093f15020a0322153c0e073f57`  

Can you decode the original phrase and reveal Ki “**BujhlamNa**” before Baba gets mad? 


**Hint:** Baba always says, "XOR logic is your best friend!" 😆

## **Problem Setter**  

This challenge was brought to you by **Shoaib Bin Rashid**, a self-proclaimed XOR wizard who may or may not have tangled himself in his own encryption! 🧙‍♂️✨  

Inspired by **CryptoHack**, he decided to cook up his own XOR puzzle—only to forget half of the keys along the way. 🤦‍♂️ Now, it's up to you to fix his mess and recover the **Baba-approved** secret phrase before it's lost forever!  

If you get stuck, just remember: **XOR is like tea in Bangladesh—you can never have just one sip!** 🍵😆  

Good luck, and may the **XOR Baba** guide you! 🚀
