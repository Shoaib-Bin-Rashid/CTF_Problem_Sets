# The Unbreakable

## Problem Statement

Behold! The **most advanced** password policy ever designed (by someone who probably still uses "1234" for their PIN):

-   **1st character:** A lowercase letter (a-z) ğŸ”¡
-   **2nd character:** An uppercase letter (A-Z) ğŸ” 
-   **3rd character:** A digit (0-9) ğŸ”¢

With a **mind-blowing** three-character length, surely this system is hacker-proof... or is it? ğŸ¤” Your mission: prove why this security is as strong as a wet paper towel. ğŸ’€ğŸ”“
