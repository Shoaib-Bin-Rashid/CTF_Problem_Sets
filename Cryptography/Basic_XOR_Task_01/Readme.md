# Basic XOR

## Problem Statement
 Chinku, the self-proclaimed "XOR-acle," encrypted a secret message using XOR with the magic number 25. Now, he forgot what it was! The only clue he left behind is this mysterious ciphertext:

```Kl|m9Z`{|k9J|zlkpm`9Zul{```

Can you outsmart Bob and decrypt his message by XORing each character with 25? Help him before he starts blaming the aliens again! ðŸ‘½ðŸ”“
